# Task 2: Clustering Analysis Report

## Data Preprocessing for Clustering

### 1. Feature Selection

We selected three primary numerical features for clustering analysis:

- **current_price**: Product pricing information
- **discount**: Discount percentage offered
- **likes_count**: Customer engagement metric
- **is_new**: Boolean indicator converted to numeric (0/1)

**Rationale**: These features capture different dimensions of product positioning - pricing strategy, customer appeal, and product lifecycle stage.

### 2. Feature Transformation

Due to the highly skewed distributions observed in our exploratory data analysis, we applied specific transformations:

#### Likes Count Transformation

- **Original**: Extremely right-skewed distribution (range: 0-400+)
- **Transformation**: log₁₊(likes_count)
- **Rationale**: Reduces extreme skewness and prevents outliers from dominating distance calculations

#### Current Price Transformation  

- **Original**: Moderately right-skewed distribution (range: $0-60)
- **Transformation**: √(current_price)
- **Rationale**: Reduces moderate skewness while preserving interpretability

#### Discount (No Transformation)

- **Original**: Bimodal but well-distributed (range: 30-70%)
- **Transformation**: None applied
- **Rationale**: Distribution already suitable for clustering algorithms

### 3. Standardization

Applied StandardScaler to all transformed features to ensure:

- Mean ≈ 0, Standard Deviation ≈ 1 for all features
- Equal contribution of features to distance calculations
- Improved algorithm convergence

## Clustering Algorithm Implementation

### Algorithm 1: K-Means Clustering

#### Detailed Steps:

1. **Optimal Cluster Determination**:
   - Applied Elbow Method to analyze inertia vs. number of clusters
   - Applied Silhouette Analysis to evaluate cluster quality

2. **Parameter Selection**:
   - **n_clusters**: 2 (based on highest silhouette score)
   - **random_state**: 42 (for reproducibility)
   - **n_init**: 10 (multiple initializations)
   - **max_iter**: 300 (sufficient convergence)

3. **Algorithm Execution**:
   - Initialized centroids using k-means++ method
   - Iteratively updated cluster assignments and centroids
   - Converged to stable cluster configuration

### Algorithm 2: DBSCAN Clustering

#### Detailed Steps:

1. **Parameter Optimization**:
   - Tested eps values: [0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5]
   - Tested min_samples values: [3, 5, 7, 10]
   - Selected parameters maximizing silhouette score

2. **Parameter Selection**:
   - **eps**: 0.5 (optimal neighborhood radius)
   - **min_samples**: 5 (minimum points per cluster)
   - **metric**: euclidean (standard distance measure)

3. **Algorithm Execution**:
   - Identified core points based on density criteria
   - Formed clusters by connecting density-reachable points
   - Classified remaining points as noise

#### DBSCAN Results:

- **Number of Clusters**: 2
- **Silhouette Score**: 0.625
- **Noise Points**: 1,247 products (2.0%)
- **Cluster Distribution**: Cluster 0: 36,909 products (60.3%), Cluster 1: 23,058 products (37.7%)
